Object Oriented Projects for Ngu

This repository holds an account project for the object-oriented design and implementations class for Texas State University.
The Program reads in data from a text file, and populates an account list. Funds can be added or withdrawn from accounts in the list
in various different currency types. This was an introductory project to the MVC architecture, and may be re-designed somewhere down the line.
